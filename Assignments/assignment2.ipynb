Upload the file in the `Assignments` folder along with a markdown document with a link to the other dataset and the proposed methodology. Ideally the related dataset will be something you have access to, but if not, describe how you would propose creating it. Come prepared to discuss, we will talk through a couple of examples next class.\n"
